              Hello! My name is Justice, and I am a multi-skilled full-stack
              developer with hands-on experience in project development. I am a
              good communicator and team player. I enjoy pair programming,
              watching movies, listening to music and writing tutorials.

              I am currently enrolled in a distance-learning software
              development program that uses pair programming and actual client
              projects to teach development. Over the past few months, I have
              been deeply engrossed in remote development, creating everything
              from landing pages to APIs and JavaScript projects.
            </Typography>
            <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}>
              In addition, I have spent the last couple of years learning
              remotely to acquire soft skills such as communication, teamwork,
              leadership, critical thinking, problem-solving, and more.
            </Typography>
            <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}>
              I am currently working on improving my writing skills to create
              tutorials that cover the skills I have learned over the years.
