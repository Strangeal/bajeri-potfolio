              Hello! My name is Justice, and I am a multi-skilled full-stack
              developer with hands-on experience in project development. I have
              one year of experience working with both front-end technologies
              (React/Redux) and back-end technologies (Ruby on Rails). I am a
              good communicator and a team player, and I enjoy pair programming.
            </Typography>
            <Typography
              variant="body1"
              sx={{ mt: 2, fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}
            >
              Over the years, I have built more than 20 projects, ranging from
              small to full-stack projects. Each project has presented its own
              unique set of challenges, from technical obstacles to pair
              programming challenges. These challenges have honed my skills in
              problem-solving, collaboration, and innovation. By continually
              pushing myself to learn new technologies and techniques, I have
              been able to expand my capabilities and take on increasingly
              complex projects.
            </Typography>
            <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}>
              In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and
              writing tutorials.

            <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}>
              I am currently working on improving my writing skills to create
              tutorials that cover the skills I have learned over the years.
